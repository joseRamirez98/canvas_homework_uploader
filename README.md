# Canvas Homework Uploader
This python script automates uploading and sumbitting one's homework assignments to Sac State's canvas site through one command line in terminal or command prompt.

## Update (3/29/21)
This python scripted was intended to be used by students who are currently attending Sac State, therefore anyone who does not have a Sac State account, and attempts to run it, will be unable to do so.

Also, Sac State now requires a two-step authorization to sign in into Sac State accounts, therefore the script may not work since it was written before the two-step authorization sign in was implemented.

## Packages
The selenium package is required in order for the script to run. If you do not already have it installed, here is the command to do so.

For Python 2
```
$ pip install selenium
```
For Python 3
```
$ pip3 install selenium
```
